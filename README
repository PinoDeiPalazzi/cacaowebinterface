  
  
  The files present in this project are all part of the cacaoweb project.

  
  Directories :
    user_interface : all the files used in the web user interface. The user interface can mostly be tested independently of the cacaoweb program, this is valid for the file index.html which is the main page of the user interface. The admin.html page, which is the management area, is yet testable independently without some minor annoyances.
	http_api : the cacaoweb program exposes functions accessible through an http API. The list of functions can be found roughly between the lines 200-500. More documentation to be written on this. To call a function, you make an http GET request to the relevant functions, for example in a default cacaoweb installation you can call "http://127.0.0.1:4001/version" in your web browser to get the version of cacaoweb or you can call "http://127.0.0.1:4001/digest" if you want to get the md5 of the current cacaoweb executable.
